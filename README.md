THIS MUST BE VIEWED ON PC AS THIS VERSION IS BEFORE THE BOOTSTRAP WAS ADDED.

This Toy business page was created in an agile enviornment in my collabrative applications class. This upload is from the first sprint.
I was assigned with creating the toy catalog page, and the auto generating page when a toy is clicked. I utilized instances of the toy class to input their data on the toy catalog page,
and then I passed the matching toy object as arguments into my function which processes the clicked toy, creates a new page, and displays the stats on the clicked toy. We used bitbucket and jira
for our project. I will update this project to our latest version in class as needed.

In this example, the first toy is chosen.
