This Toy business page was created in an agile enviornment in my collabrative applications class. This upload is from the first sprint.
I was assigned with creating the toy catalog page, and the auto generating page when a toy is clicked. I utilized instances of the toy class to input their data on the toy catalog page,
and then I passed the matching toy object as arguments into my function which processes the clicked toy, creates a new page, and displays the stats on the clicked toy. We used bitbucket and jira
for our project.
